<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I am a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies.
   Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various modern frameworks such as 
   React and Vue.js, enabling me to build responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites. 
   My commitment to clean, maintainable code and best practices ensures that every project I work on is 
   efficient, scalable, and optimized for performance.</p>

<p> In addition to front-end development, I have experience working with server-side technologies like Node.js,
    Express, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL. This full-stack expertise allows me to create seamless,
    end-to-end web applications that meet client requirements and provide smooth user experiences. I enjoy 
    tackling complex problems and continuously learning new tools and techniques to stay ahead in the 
    ever-evolving web development landscape.</p> 
  
<p>Beyond coding, I am a strong communicator and collaborator who thrives in team environments. I believe that
   understanding client goals and user needs is essential to delivering impactful digital solutions. 
   Whether working independently or as part of a development team, I am dedicated to producing high-quality 
   work that drives business success and helps brands establish a strong online presence.</p>
